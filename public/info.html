                The most common reason that deaf people are still socially outcasts is their ineffective communication and lack of awareness about sign languages. 
                This project aims to act as a step in helping effective communication between deaf people and others.
                In our approach, we will use landmarking models that track the motion of the user's hands relative to their face. 
                The main points which will be tracked are the joints in the fingers, wrist and shoulders. 
                Their relative position in the frame shall be tracked by noting their coordinates and normalizing their values. 
                This data will then be used to perform feature extraction to form the data which will be used by our deep learning model.
                It is created by Srinivas, Rahul and Rachit from Vellore Institute of Technology.
